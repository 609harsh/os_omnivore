MAS has said it wants to attract leading crypto players to Singapore. On the other hand, MAS has a stringent and lengthy licensing process for those who want to carry out crypto-related services.  MAS has also been issuing strong warnings against retail investments in cryptocurrencies and has been taking increasingly stronger measures to restrict retail access to cryptocurrencies. "),

Some others have lamented that MAS has made a “u-turn” in its digital asset policies.  They say that MAS was once “making pro-crypto decisions” but was now being “overly cautious and losing its appeal as a global crypto hub”. Yet others see MAS as having struck the right balance, that “the crypto winter is proving MAS’ policies to be right”. "),

To understand the issues more sharply and what the benefits and risks are, we need to be clear what the different components of this ecosystem are. I can understand why there is confusion about cryptocurrencies, blockchains, and digital assets.  The inherent complexity of this ecosystem has made it difficult even for MAS to get its messages across. So, today, we will try to do a better job of explaining the ecosystem and its different components – and what MAS is actively promoting; what MAS is discouraging; and what are the risks MAS is seeking to manage.  My apologies if the next couple of minutes sound like a tutorial but it is important that we are clear about the concepts we are dealing with. "),
  ////      Utterance(text: "A good place to start is with digital assets."),
  ////      Utterance(text: " A digital asset is anything of value whose ownership is represented in a digital or computerised form. This is done through a process called tokenisation – which involves using a software programme to convert ownership rights over an asset into a digital token. Many items can potentially be tokenised: financial assets like cash and bonds,  real assets like artwork and property,  even intangible items like carbon credits and computing resources.  In other words, anything that has value, when tokenised, becomes a digital asset.   Digital assets are typically deployed on distributed ledgers that record the ownership and transfer of ownership of these assets.   A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger that organises transaction records into blocks of data which are cryptographically linked together.  When deployed on distributed ledgers, digital assets are referred to as crypto assets. "),
  ////      Utterance(text: "It is this innovative combination of tokenisation and distributed ledgers that offers transformative economic potential."),

It is this crypto or digital asset ecosystem that supports use cases which can potentially facilitate more efficient transactions, enhance financial inclusion, and unlock economic value. "),

As I mentioned earlier, cryptocurrencies serve a useful function within a blockchain network – to reward the participants who help to validate and maintain the record of transactions on the distributed ledger. But outside a blockchain network, cryptocurrencies serve no useful function except as a vehicle for speculation. Since 2017, MAS has been issuing warnings about the substantial risks of investing in cryptocurrencies. "),

They seek to combine the credibility that comes from their supposed stability, with the benefits of tokenisation, that allow them to be used as payment instruments on distributed ledgers. Stablecoins are beginning to find acceptance outside of the crypto ecosystem.  Some firms like Mastercard have integrated popular stablecoins into their payment services.  This can be a positive development if stablecoins can make payments cheaper, faster, and safer. But to reap the benefits of stablecoins, regulators must ensure that they are indeed stable.  I will talk more about this later. "),

  ////      Utterance(text: " CBDCs are the direct liability of, and payment instrument, of a central bank. This means that holders of CBDCs will have a direct claim on the central bank that has issued them, similar to how physical currency works today. Wholesale CBDCs are restricted to use by financial institutions. They are akin to the balances which commercial banks place with a central bank today.  Wholesale CBDCs on a distributed ledger have the potential to achieve atomic settlement, or the exchange of two linked assets in real-time.  They have the potential to radically transform cross-border payments, which today are slow, expensive, and opaque. "),

The case for a retail CBDC in Singapore is not compelling for now, given well-functioning payment systems and broad financial inclusion.   Retail electronic payment systems are fast, efficient, and at zero cost, while a residual amount of cash remains in circulation and is unlikely to disappear.  Nevertheless, MAS is building the technology infrastructure that would permit issuance of retail CBDCs should conditions change. "),

The online nature of transactions adds to the risk. In 2020, MAS imposed on providers of digital asset services the same anti-money laundering requirements that apply to other financial institutions. Earlier this year, these rules were expanded to Singapore-incorporated entities providing digital asset services overseas. Singapore’s requirements are consistent with international standards, namely those of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). "),

But technology and cyber risks are continually evolving, for example, coding bugs in smart contracts and compromise of digital token wallets or their encryption keys. MAS is reviewing measures to manage these and other technology and cyber risks, including further requirements to protect customers’ digital assets and uplift system availability. These steps are in line with what other jurisdictions are considering, including in the EU and Japan. "),

It is very risky for the public to put their monies in such cryptocurrencies, as the perceived valuation of these cryptocurrencies could plummet rapidly when sentiments shift.  We have seen this happen repeatedly.  MAS has issued numerous advisories warning consumers that they could potentially lose all the monies they put into cryptocurrencies. Just take for example Luna, the sister token of the so-called stablecoin TerraUSD.  Luna was, at one point, worth over US$100 but tumbled to zero. "),

  ////      Utterance(text: " This appears to be a global phenomenon, not just in Singapore.  Many consumers are still enticed by the prospect of sharp price increases in cryptocurrencies. They seem to be irrationally oblivious about the risks of cryptocurrency trading.  Consumer-related risks have gained the attention of regulators around the world.  "),

MAS is actively involved in international regulatory reviews to enhance market integrity and customer protection in the digital asset space.  Second, the industry has an important role in co-creating sensible measures to protect consumer interests.  MAS has been sharing its concerns with the industry and inviting views on possible measures to minimise harm to consumers.  We will publicly consult on the proposals by October this year. Third, consumers must take responsibility and exercise judgement and caution.

There is risk of contagion to financial markets through exposures of financial institutions to digital assets. MAS is working closely with other regulators to design a prudential framework for banks’ exposures to digital assets.  This framework will provide banks with clarity on how to measure the risks of their digital asset exposures, and maintain adequate capital to address these risks.
